Contacing the authors
---------------------

If you have found a bug, have a patch or a question or would like to
make a suggestion please send email to one of our public mailing lists
instead of to one or more of the authors.  This avoids both potential
duplication of work and delays caused by possible vacations.  Mailing
list subscription is explained at <http://www.ginac.de/Lists.html>.
